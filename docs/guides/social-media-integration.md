# Social Media Integration — Omnya Portal

This document covers the **OAuth-based social-media integration** for creators:
TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. It explains the data flow, the
required env vars, how to wire each provider's developer console, the database
tables involved, the RLS model, and how to troubleshoot the most common
failure modes.

The analytics-sync side of this feature (cron, manual refresh, dashboard
rendering) is being delivered in the next iteration; this document focuses on
**connect / disconnect / status** and the shared foundations.

## 1. Supported platforms

| Platform   | Provider OAuth          | Refresh token? | Notes |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------|-------|
| TikTok     | TikTok v2 OAuth + PKCE  | Yes            | PKCE required for SPA clients. |
| Instagram  | Meta Login              | No (long-lived ~60d) | Stored under `platform='instagram'`. |
| Facebook   | Meta Login              | No (long-lived ~60d) | Stored under `platform='facebook'`. |
| Meta       | Meta Login              | No (long-lived ~60d) | "Generic" Meta connection (`platform='meta'`). |
| YouTube    | Google OAuth (offline)  | Yes            | `access_type=offline&prompt=consent`. |

Each branded button writes a separately-labelled row in `creator_tokens`. The
three Meta-backed flows share one callback (`/api/auth/meta/callback`); the
callback figures out the correct platform label from the `oauth_states`
record.

```

Key properties:

1. **State is server-stored and hashed.** The browser only ever sees the
   random opaque string; the server holds the SHA-256 hash plus
   `(user_id, platform, expires_at, used_at)`. A callback with a state we
   didn't issue, an expired state, or a state already consumed is rejected.
2. **State is bound to the platform.** A `tiktok` state can't be replayed
   against the `youtube` callback.
3. **PKCE for TikTok.** The `code_verifier` is stored alongside the state and
   sent to TikTok on code exchange. The browser never sees the verifier.
4. **Tokens stay server-side.** The frontend never receives
   `access_token`/`refresh_token`. The browser-readable connection state
   comes from `/api/social/connections` (or, defensively, the
   `creator_connection_status` view), which omits both columns.

---

## 3. Required environment variables

Place these in Vercel (Production, Preview, Development) and mirror in
`.env.local` for local dev. The portal's `.env.example` is the source of
truth for naming.

### Shared
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-side Supabase admin client. |
| `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`, `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Client-side Supabase. |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the deployed portal (e.g. `https://www.portalomnyagrowth.com`). Used to compose default redirect URIs and post-callback redirects. |
| `ADDITIONAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (optional) | Comma-separated extra origins to add to the CORS allow-list (e.g. preview deployments). |

### TikTok
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY` | TikTok app client key. |
| `TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET` | TikTok app client secret. |
| `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` (optional) | Override for `${APP_BASE_URL}/api/auth/tiktok/callback`. Must match what's registered in the TikTok developer portal. |

### Meta / Instagram / Facebook
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `META_APP_ID` *or* `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` *or* `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` | Meta app id. The three names are tried in order; supply whichever matches your existing convention. |
| `META_APP_SECRET` *or* `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` *or* `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` | Meta app secret. |
| `META_REDIRECT_URI` (optional) | Override for `${APP_BASE_URL}/api/auth/meta/callback`. Must match Meta App > Settings > Valid OAuth Redirect URIs. |

### YouTube
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client id (Web application type). |
| `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret. |
| `YOUTUBE_REDIRECT_URI` (optional) | Override for `${APP_BASE_URL}/api/auth/youtube/callback`. Must match Authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console. |

---

## 4. Provider console setup

For each platform, register the callback URL exactly as the routes expect:

| Platform | Where to register | URL to register |
|---|---|---|
| TikTok | TikTok Developer Portal → your app → Login Kit → Redirect URI | `${APP_BASE_URL}/api/auth/tiktok/callback` |
| Meta (IG/FB) | Meta App Dashboard → Login → Settings → Valid OAuth Redirect URIs | `${APP_BASE_URL}/api/auth/meta/callback` |
| YouTube | Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client → Authorized redirect URIs | `${APP_BASE_URL}/api/auth/youtube/callback` |

For local development, register `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/<p>/callback`
*and* set `APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` in `.env.local`. Some providers
(TikTok in particular) require an HTTPS URL for production but accept
localhost for development.

---

## 5. Database tables

Defined in `supabase/migrations/20260522000000_social_media_feature.sql`
(plus columns added in the hardening migration).

### `creator_tokens`
The canonical token store. Keyed by `(user_id, platform)` UNIQUE.

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user_id`, `platform` | Composite key. `platform` ∈ {tiktok, instagram, facebook, meta, youtube}. |
| `access_token`, `refresh_token` | OAuth credentials. **Never returned to the browser.** |
| `token_type`, `scope` | From the provider's token response. |
| `expires_at`, `refresh_expires_at` | TTLs for the two tokens. |
| `platform_user_id`, `platform_username` | Provider identity (e.g. TikTok `open_id`, YouTube channel id/title). |
| `status` | `connected` / `expired` / `revoked` / `error` / `disconnected`. |
| `last_synced_at`, `last_error` | Updated by analytics sync. |
| `metadata` | JSONB sidecar for provider-specific fields. |

`creator_id` is kept (nullable) for compatibility with legacy callers — see
AUDIT.md §4.8 for the schism resolution.

### `oauth_states`
Short-lived nonce store. Service-role only; deny-all RLS.

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `state_hash` | SHA-256 of the random state we sent to the provider. |
| `code_verifier` | PKCE verifier (TikTok only). |
| `platform`, `user_id` | Binding — a state can only be consumed by the matching callback. |
| `expires_at` | 10-minute TTL. |
| `used_at` | Set on first successful consume; prevents replay. |

### `creator_connection_status` (view)
Defensive frontend projection. Same data as `creator_tokens` minus the raw
token columns. Inherits RLS from the base table via `security_invoker=true`.

### `video_analytics`
Holds per-submission social metrics. The next iteration's analytics-sync work
populates `user_id`, `video_url`, `watch_time_seconds`, `engagement_rate`, and
`raw_metrics` — all added by this migration.

---

## 6. RLS model

| Table | Authenticated reads | Authenticated writes |
|---|---|---|
| `creator_tokens` | `user_id = auth.uid()` OR `owner` | None — server-side only |
| `oauth_states` | none (deny-all) | none — server-side only |
| `video_analytics` | owner / self / assigned-AM | None — server-side only |
| `creator_connection_status` | inherits creator_tokens | view is read-only |

Service-role endpoints (`api/auth/**/*`, `api/social/connections`,
`api/auth/disconnect`) bypass RLS but each one re-checks authorization
explicitly using the helpers in `api/_utils/auth.js`.

---

## 7. API surface

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/auth/tiktok/start` | POST | JWT | Generate state + PKCE, return authorization URL. |
| `/api/auth/tiktok/callback` | GET | None (provider) | Exchange code, store tokens, redirect to portal. |
| `/api/auth/instagram/start` | POST | JWT | Same shape as TikTok, no PKCE. Label='instagram'. |
| `/api/auth/facebook/start` | POST | JWT | Label='facebook'. |
| `/api/auth/meta/start` | POST | JWT | Label='meta' (generic). |
| `/api/auth/meta/callback` | GET | None | Shared callback for IG/FB/Meta. |
| `/api/auth/youtube/start` | POST | JWT | Requests offline access + refresh token. |
| `/api/auth/youtube/callback` | GET | None | |
| `/api/auth/disconnect` | POST | JWT | Soft-delete creator's token for given platform. |
| `/api/social/connections` | GET | JWT | Safe status read; supports `?userId=` for owner/AM. |
| `/api/analytics/sync` | POST | `CRON_SECRET` | 12-hour cron (next iteration: aligned with new schema). |

**Response shape** for all `/api/*` endpoints that return JSON:

```json
{ "ok": true, "data": { ... } }
{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": "forbidden", "message": "...", "details": {} } }
```

---

## 8. Connect flow (frontend)

`src/pages/CreatorConnections.js` implements:

1. On mount, calls `GET /api/social/connections`. Renders one card per
   platform, defaulting unconfigured platforms to `disconnected`.
2. **Connect button** → `POST /api/auth/<platform>/start` with the user's
   JWT. Server returns `{ authorizationUrl }`. Frontend sets
   `window.location.href = authorizationUrl`.
3. Provider redirects back to `${APP_BASE_URL}/?page=social-connections&connected=<platform>`
   on success, or `&error=<code>` on failure. The mount-effect surfaces a
   toast and scrubs the query string.
4. **Disconnect button** → `POST /api/auth/disconnect` with `{ platform }`.
   Server soft-deletes (clears tokens, sets `status='disconnected'`).
5. **Reconnect button** appears when `status === 'expired'` or
   `expires_at < now()`. It runs the same connect flow.

---

## 9. Manual reconnection of a creator

If a creator reports their connection isn't working and the UI doesn't
auto-detect the failure:

1. As **owner**, hit `GET /api/social/connections?userId=<creator-user-id>`
   to see their status across all platforms.
2. If `last_error` is informative, fix the underlying issue (e.g. re-grant
   permissions in the provider's settings).
3. Ask the creator to click **Reconnect** in the portal. Their token row is
   upserted with fresh credentials; no manual SQL needed.

For owners who want to invalidate a creator's token (e.g. they're offboarding):
have them click Disconnect, or run via SQL:

```sql
UPDATE creator_tokens
SET access_token = NULL, refresh_token = NULL, status = 'revoked',
    updated_at = now()
WHERE user_id = '<creator-user-id>' AND platform = '<platform>';
```

---

## 10. Common errors

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Connect button does nothing | Browser blocking JS errors. Inspect DevTools — most likely missing env var on server. | Check Vercel env vars for the relevant `*_CLIENT_KEY` / `*_APP_ID`. |
| `?error=tiktok_invalid_state` | State expired (>10 min) or already used. | Re-click Connect; state is single-use. |
| `?error=tiktok_token_exchange_failed` | Redirect URI mismatch, or wrong client key/secret. | Verify the URI in TikTok dev portal matches `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI`. |
| `?error=meta_token_exchange_failed` | Meta app secret mismatch, or unapproved scope. | Re-issue secret in Meta dashboard. Confirm scopes are available for the app's current review status. |
| Connection succeeds but `lastError` says permission issue | Provider account lacks IG Business account / page admin rights. | Have the creator promote their IG account to Business and re-connect. |
| `?error=youtube_misconfigured` | `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET` missing. | Set them in Vercel and redeploy. |
| User says "I disconnected but the button still shows Connect" | Browser cache. | Force refresh — the disconnect API updates DB synchronously. |

For deeper debugging, check Vercel function logs for `[<platform>/callback]
*_failed` lines. Logs intentionally omit token bodies; you'll see HTTP status
and a short error description only.

### Every provider fails, each with a different error

Seen 2026-09-20: all four Connect buttons reached the provider and each was
refused on the provider's own page. That pattern is itself the diagnosis — the
portal is building correct requests and the faults are in the four developer
consoles, not in this codebase. Each provider is configured independently, so
they are four separate jobs.

| Provider | What the creator sees | Cause | Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| TikTok | "Something went wrong … client_key" | App not Live; production key unusable | [below](#tiktok-something-went-wrong--correct-the-following-client_key) |
| YouTube | "Access blocked: … has not completed the Google verification process", `Error 403: access_denied` | Consent screen in **Testing**; signer is not a test user | [below](#youtube-access-blocked--has-not-completed-the-google-verification-process) |
| Facebook | "App not active" | Meta app in **Development** mode; signer has no app role | [below](#facebook-app-not-active) |
| Instagram | "Invalid Request: Request parameters are invalid: Invalid platform app" | Wrong app id — the Facebook one, not the Instagram one | [below](#instagram-invalid-platform-app) |

The common shape: **all four platforms restrict an unreviewed app to a named
list of people.** Until each app passes its review, only accounts you add
explicitly can connect. Two of the four below are fixed by adding the tester;
one needs a different credential; one needs a sandbox.

---

### Instagram: "Invalid platform app"

The only one of the four that was a fault on our side, now fixed in code.

A Meta app that has *API setup with Instagram login* configured carries **two
different app ids**. The Facebook app id (the one in the Facebook Login dialog
URL) is *not* accepted by `instagram.com/oauth/authorize`; that endpoint wants
the **Instagram App ID**, found at *App Dashboard → Instagram → API setup with
Instagram login → 3. Set up Instagram business login → Business login settings*.

`INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` had been set to the Facebook app id, so Instagram rejected
the request before showing a consent screen.

Fix:

1. Copy the **Instagram App ID** from the path above.
2. Set `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` in Vercel to that value, and `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET`
   to the matching **Instagram App Secret** from the same panel.
3. Register the redirect URI under *Business login settings → OAuth redirect
   URIs*: `https://www.portalomnyagrowth.com/api/auth/instagram/callback`.
   It must match exactly; Meta sometimes appends a trailing slash, so check
   what was saved.
4. Redeploy.

The portal now refuses to start this flow when `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` is missing or
equals the Facebook app id, and says which it is — on the Connect button and on
*System Config → Social sign-in redirect URIs*. Previously it sent the creator
to Instagram's black error page, which names nothing.

While the app is in Development mode, the Instagram account must also be added
under *App roles → Roles* (or as an Instagram tester) and the invitation
accepted.

---

### Facebook: "App not active"

Meta's wording is misleading — nothing is broken and no outage is in progress.
It means the app is in **Development mode** and the signing-in account has no
role on it. Meta says apps in Development mode "can only request permissions
from role users."

Fix, either:

- **For testing now:** *App Dashboard → App roles → Roles → Add people* and add
  the tester as Administrator, Developer or Tester. They must accept the
  invitation (it arrives in their Facebook notifications) before it works.
- **For real creators:** switch the app to **Live**, which requires a privacy
  policy URL and completing **App Review** for the permissions requested. The
  portal asks for `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement` and
  `pages_read_user_content`; in Live mode, only permissions approved through
  App Review are granted.

---

### YouTube: "Access blocked — has not completed the Google verification process"

`Error 403: access_denied`, with "The app is currently being tested, and can
only be accessed by developer-approved testers." The Google Cloud OAuth consent
screen is in **Testing**, where only listed test users can sign in.

Fix, either:

- **For testing now:** Google Cloud Console → *APIs & Services → OAuth consent
  screen → Audience → Test users → Add users*, and add the exact Google account
  (the screenshot shows `koinyannelson0@gmail.com` being refused). Up to 100.
  Note that in Testing, refresh tokens expire after **7 days**, so connections
  will need remaking — expected, not a bug.
- **For real creators:** *Publish app*, then *Prepare for verification*.
  `youtube.readonly` is a sensitive scope, so
  Google requires verification: scope justification and a demo video of the
  OAuth flow. Until verified, users see an "unverified app" warning they can
  click through, or are blocked outright.

Also note `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID` is a placeholder in the local `.env`; the real
value is only in Vercel. That is fine for production but means the YouTube flow
cannot be exercised locally.

---

### TikTok: "Something went wrong — correct the following: client_key"

This is TikTok's own page (on tiktok.com, after the creator signs in), so the
portal never sees a callback and nothing is logged on our side. The list under
"correct the following" is the diagnosis: TikTok names the parameter it
rejected. `client_key` means the key itself is not usable for this login — the
redirect URI and scopes were not even evaluated. Seen on 2026-09-18 with the
production key.

TikTok apps have two modes. **Production** credentials only serve real logins
once the app has been submitted for review and is **Live**. Until then, use
**Sandbox** mode, which has its own client key and secret and works without
review for up to 10 named TikTok accounts ("target users"). Testing with the
production key before approval, or with an account that is not a target user,
produces exactly this page.

Fix, in order:

1. In [developers.tiktok.com](https://developers.tiktok.com) → *Manage apps* →
   the app, check the status. If it is not **Live**, flip the toggle next to
   the app name to **Sandbox** (create one if needed).
2. In the sandbox: add the **Login Kit** product with the **Web** platform and
   register the exact redirect URI the portal sends — shown on the owner's
   *System Config* page (default `https://www.portalomnyagrowth.com/api/auth/tiktok/callback`).
   Add scopes `user.info.basic` and `video.list`. Under *Target users*, add
   the TikTok account(s) that will test — each must accept TikTok's prompt.
3. Copy the **sandbox** client key and secret into Vercel as
   `TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY` / `TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET` (Production environment) and
   **redeploy** — serverless functions read env vars at deploy time.
4. When the app is approved and Live, put the production key and secret back
   and redeploy. TikTok's review requires a demo video of the login flow, which
   the docs say to record against the sandbox.

If the app *is* Live and this still appears, the key is wrong: compare it
character for character with *App details → Credentials* (a stray space or
the secret pasted into the key field are the usual suspects) and confirm the
Login Kit product is added to the production app.

## 11. Deployment checklist (per environment)

- [ ] Apply migrations in order: `20260521000000_omnya_hardening.sql`, then
      `20260522000000_social_media_feature.sql`.
- [ ] Set all env vars listed in §3. `APP_BASE_URL` must match the
      environment's actual URL.
- [ ] Register every callback URL with its respective provider (see §4).
- [ ] Verify Supabase RLS is on for `creator_tokens`, `oauth_states`,
      `video_analytics`.
- [ ] Smoke test: sign in as a creator, click Connect for each platform, verify
      the creator card shows the connected username and Last synced shows
      "—" (until the next cron run).
- [ ] Smoke test: sign in as owner, hit `GET /api/social/connections?userId=<creator>`,
      confirm no `access_token` / `refresh_token` appears in the JSON.
- [ ] Smoke test: try a forged state URL (`/api/auth/tiktok/callback?code=foo&state=bar`)
      and confirm a clean redirect to `?error=tiktok_invalid_state`.

---

## 12. Next iteration (analytics)

Tracked separately:

- Analytics sync rewrite against the new `creator_tokens` schema, with token
  refresh, per-platform error reporting, and structured logging.
- `POST /api/analytics/manual-sync` for creator-initiated refresh.
- `src/pages/AnalyticsDashboard.js` rewrite to query the new normalized columns
  and surface `last_error` per submission.
- Removal of the legacy `creator_id`-based routes
  (`api/analytics/refresh.js`, `api/analytics/fetch.js`, `api/analytics.js`,
  `api/auth/tiktok/disconnect.js`, `api/auth/meta/disconnect.js`).
